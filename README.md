# Python Learning Journey 🐍

Hi! This is my Python practice repository. I'm currently learning Python and uploading all the small and big programs I write as I learn.

### 📁 Folder Structure:

- `basics/` – Printing, Input/output, Data types (int, float, str), Type casting, Variables, Comments, Basic math operations
- `control_flow(if else cond.)/` – if, if-else, elif, Nested ifs, match
- `control_flow/` - for loops, while loops, Loop with range(), break, continue, pass
- `functions/` – Defining functions, Parameters & return values, Recursion
- `projects/` – small projects like calculator etc.

### 🧠 Purpose:
This repo helps me:
- Keep track of what I’ve learned
- Revisit and improve old code
- Share progress publicly

### 🚀 How to Run the Code

1. Clone this repository or download the ZIP file.
2. Navigate to any `.py` file you want to run.
