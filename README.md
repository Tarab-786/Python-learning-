# Python Learning Journey 🐍

Hi! This is my Python practice repository. I'm currently learning Python and uploading all the small and big programs I write as I learn.

### 📁 Folder Structure:

- `basics/` – hello world, variables, input/output
- `control_flow/` – if-else
- `control_flow/` - loops
- `functions/` – function definitions, recursion
- `projects/` – small projects like calculator, to-do list

### 🧠 Purpose:
This repo helps me:
- Keep track of what I’ve learned
- Revisit and improve old code
- Share progress publicly

### 🚀 How to Run the Code

1. Clone this repository or download the ZIP file.
2. Navigate to any `.py` file you want to run.
3. Run using:

```bash
python filename.py
